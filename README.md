## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get the application running on your Windows machine.

### Prerequisites

- A **Windows** operating system (7, 8, 10, 11).
- An active **internet connection** for downloading videos, FFmpeg, and application updates.

### Installation & Usage

1.  **Download the Application**
    - Go to the [**Releases**]((https://github.com/marfre001/YoutubeDownloader/releases/tag/v1.0)) page of this repository.
    - Download the latest `YouTube-Downloader-Pro.zip` file.
    - Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder on your computer (e.g., on your Desktop).

2.  **Install FFmpeg (One-Time Setup)**
    - Before downloading audio, you need FFmpeg. We've made this easy!
    - Open the extracted folder and double-click on `Install_FFmpeg.bat`.
    - A command prompt window will appear and guide you through the automatic download and setup.
    - **‚ö†Ô∏è Windows SmartScreen Warning:** Windows might show a security warning. This is normal for batch scripts. Click **"More info"** and then **"Run anyway"** to proceed.
    - This step only needs to be done once.

3.  **Run the Application**
    - To start the downloader, double-click the `Start_App.bat` file.
    - A small **"Loading" window** will appear first. It's checking for updates for the downloader component. This might take a few seconds. The main application will launch automatically afterward.
    - **Important**: Do not close the black terminal window that opens in the background while the app is running!

## üîß How It Works (Technical Details)

This project is designed to be as user-friendly as possible by bundling its dependencies.

-   **Embedded Python**: The application uses a portable, embedded version of **Python**. This means users don't need to have Python installed on their system.
-   **Core Downloader**: The heavy lifting of downloading and processing is done by the excellent [**`yt-dlp`**](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) library.
-   **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The interface is built using **Tkinter**, Python's standard GUI toolkit, with `ttk` for a more modern look and feel. The main window features a scrollable canvas to ensure usability on all screen resolutions.
-   **Batch Scripts**:
    -   `Install_FFmpeg.bat`: A helper script that downloads the latest "essentials" build of FFmpeg from [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/), extracts it to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FFmpeg`, and permanently adds its `bin` directory to the user's `PATH`.
    -   `Start_App.bat`: This script launches `ytd.py`. The Python script first displays a loading screen while a background thread runs `python -m pip install --upgrade yt-dlp` to ensure the core downloader is always up-to-date. Once complete, it launches the main Tkinter application.
